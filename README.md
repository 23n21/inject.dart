### Can I use this with Flutter?

_Yes_, `package:inject` is framework and platform agnostic, and works perfectly
well with Flutter or any other framework. We'll be releasing more
documentation and samples of using this package with `flutter` in the future.

### Can I use this with AngularDart?

While technically, _yes_ (`package:inject` is framework and platform agnostic),
the existing dependency injection framework in AngularDart is better suited for
the idioms of that framework. We welcome experimentation and new ideas, though!

### Can I use this with server-side Dart?

_Yes_, `package:inject` is framework and platform agnostic, and works perfectly
well with any server-side Dart framework. You may want to consult your specific
framework though - they might already have a preferred dependency injection
pattern.
